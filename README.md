# Students-Marks-Prediction
This project focuses on predicting students' marks based on the number of study hours. Using data analysis techniques and a machine learning model, this project walks through the key steps of data cleaning, visualization, and prediction to provide insights into how study time influences academic performance.

# Project Overview
This project is designed to:
Load and explore a dataset (StudentInfo.csv) containing students' study hours and their corresponding marks.
Perform basic data cleaning and exploration to understand the structure of the data.
Visualize the relationship between study hours and student marks through a scatter plot.
Use machine learning (sklearn) to build and evaluate a predictive model.
# Dataset
The dataset StudentInfo.csv contains the following key features:
study_hours: The number of hours students studied.
student_marks: The corresponding marks obtained by students.
# Key Steps
# Data Loading and Exploration:
Load the dataset and display initial statistics.
Check for missing values, null values, and basic descriptive statistics.
# Data Visualization:
Plot a scatter plot showing the relationship between students' study hours and their marks.
# Model Building:
It involves training a predictive model using sklearn to estimate student marks based on study hours.
# Technologies Used:
Python
Pandas, NumPy (for data manipulation)
Matplotlib (for data visualization)
Scikit-learn (for machine learning)
# Visualizations
Scatter plot showing the correlation between study hours and student marks.
